## Best seller books

Welcome to my Module 4 Functional programming assignment. 
For this project I conected to the [New York Times Books API](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) and created a website where you can look through their best seller lists and find a new random book to read. 

The project is based on learning about functional programming and using and functions like map(), filter(), find() and forEach().

Hope you like it!
